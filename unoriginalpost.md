# The Full List of Spam and Unoriginal Posts

As you know, this subreddit has many unoriginal and spam post every week. In order to keep this subreddit clean, we've created this list and will take action on such posts.


Here's a list of post that we consider as spam.

Any post that is a spam may be removed by moderators.

We might approve a post that counts as spam if it is funny. Also, we might remove a post even if it's not on this list. It's up to the moderator's discretion.

## Section 1: Posts that is considered as spam

1. Chainposts
2. Posting about a video that get billions of views under 3 seconds, that's just the channel name as explained by Timeworks in this [video](https://youtu.be/_SH0OjR5jns).
3. Known YouTube glitch/new feature (go to Section 2, 3 and 4)
4. Asking for upvotes (e.g. putting "Upvote so Timeworks can see" in post title. But if it is a high effort post, just let it go.)
5. Self-promoting your channel or anything else (we only allow self-promotion if it adds value to your post)
6. Reposted memes (crosspost the meme instead of reposting it, otherwise mention the origin of that meme in comments)
7. Reposted rickroll (Please check if the rickroll image/video is already posted in the subreddit or not)
9. Frequently reposting your previous post that doesn't get into Frolic Friday (it's fine if you repost your post once)
